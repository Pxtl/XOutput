XOutput is a simple DirectInput to XInput wrapper made in C#. It uses the SCPDriver has a backend.

#Building

XOutput can be built in Visual Studio 2015+. It depends on the SlimDX developer SDK which can be found [here](http://slimdx.org/)

#How to Set Up

1. Download and install the official Xbox 360 Controller driver [here](http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/d/xbox-360-controller-for-windows)
2. Run ScpDriver.exe
3. Click install, wait until it finishes to close it
4. Run XOutput and set up your controller mappings
5. Click "Start"

#Beta Note

User "stents-" has stopped updating XOutput so this is Pxtl's fork of the system.  
I intend to move fast and break things.  Future releases will not be compatible with current config files,
and featuresets will change without notice.
